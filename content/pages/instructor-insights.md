## Instructor Insights

Below, Professor Jonathan Gruber describes various aspects of how he teaches _14.01 Principles of Microeconomics_.

{{< quote "You only really understand something when you go out in the real world and apply it." "— Prof. Jonathan Gruber" >}}

Professor Gruber wants to train students to think like economists. Economics uses elegant mathematical models to explain how people make decisions and allocate their resources—but all too often those models are taught in ways that remain disconnected from students’ own experience. In an interview on OCW’s [Chalk Radio podcast](https://chalk-radio.simplecast.com/episodes/thinking-like-an-economist-with-prof-jonathan-gruber), Professor Gruber shares his thoughts on bridging that gap in his course _14.01 Introductory Microeconomics_ (the name given to _14.01 Principles of Microeconomics_ in its version on the MITx platform). He says he tries to anchor learning with real-world examples; as he explains, “You only really understand something when you go out in the real world and apply it.” And those examples, he says, have to be relatable. So rather than discussing companies none of his students have heard of or commodities nobody cares about, he illustrates fundamental economic concepts with examples like Kim Kardashian’s exercise corset, Uber’s policy of surge pricing, and LeBron James’s decision not to attend college. By engaging students with accessible examples of economic principles in action, Professor Gruber helps them develop economic intuition—a sense of how the mathematical models apply in the real, seemingly chaotic world.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### Lecture

Prof. Gruber’s lecture classes met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session; 27 sessions total; mandatory attendance. Students taking the course in this format also had one recitation per week; students taking the course in an optional section format had three 1-hour section meetings per week in place of the lectures and recitation.

### Recitation

Recitations, conducted by the graduate TAs, met 1 time per week for 1 hour per session; these sessions introduced new material in addition to reviewing material from the lectures.

### Out of Class

Students spent time out of class completing problem sets and studying for exams.

## Course Team Roles

### Professor Gruber

Delivering lectures; holding regular office hours

### Teaching Assistants (5)
